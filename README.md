# Tag Version 2.0.2-dev

A simple script based on node.js (without dependencies) to help correctly upgrade versions and tag them with git.

The ideas are:

- I want to have at least one file that contains the actual version so it can be displayed and distributed easily.
- Commits that represent development should be at a `X.Y.Z-dev` version. This way I always know when a program / library is in development.
- There should always be **only one** commit that has the version `X.Y.Z`. When somebody uses a JS file of mine, or views a documentation where the version number is printed at the bottom, and the version is `X.Y.Z` (without `-dev`), s/he *knows* that this is the one and only `X.Y.Z` release, not some development phase that came after this release.
- It is possible to configure this script so it updates multiple version occurences in multiple files. The version occurence can be the default `X.Y.Z(-dev)` pattern, or a complex regular expression. It's stored in the .tagconfig file.



This helps me achieve [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), and implementend the [successful branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).


## Installation

    npm install -g versiontag

## Usage

Use the help to view a list of available commands:

    tag -h


The first time you run `tag` you probably want to add new files `tag` should replace the versions in.
Do this by running `tag --add`

The generated `.tagconfig.json` file looks approximately like this:

    {
      "files": [
        {
          "name": "tag",
          "regexs": [
            "version = '###'"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

You can add regular expressions to `regexs` so multiple versions can be found, and add additional files.

**WARNING**: When you use a selfmade regular expression, make sure you use groups that don't capture, like this: (?:stuff)

As soon as the config is created, add the `.tagconfig.json` to your repository and commit it (this way you have a clean commit).

The next time you start the script you will see the detected version, and the proposed next versions.

## Renaming only

Sometimes you only want to rename your version without actually tagging the whole thing.

To do so, call `tag` with the `r` (`--rename`) option:

    tag -r

### Manual versioning

When you **don't** want to upgrade version `1.2.3-dev` to `1.2.3`, or version `1.2.3` to `1.2.4`, you can specify the next version manually with the `-t` (`--tag`) option:

    tag -t 2.0.0

After commiting this version, the script automatically increases the version, and appends `-dev`. If you also want to control this, you can also use the `-d` (`--dev`) option:

    tag -t 2.0.0 -d 3.0.0-dev

(I strongly recommend it being a `-dev` version)

## Output

When calling `tag`, a typical output looks like this:
